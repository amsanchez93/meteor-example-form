This sample application illustrates how to manipulate user input using forms with [Meteor 1.4](http://meteor.com), [BlazeJS](http://blazejs.org/), and [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/).

## Prerequisites

To best understand this application, it is useful to first familiarize yourself with:

* [Meteor Application Template](http://ics-software-engineering.github.io/meteor-application-template/). This sample application illustrates conventions for directory layout, naming conventions, routing, and coding standards. Meteor-example-form is based on this template, but we won't discuss these issues here.

* [Blaze Templates](http://blazejs.org/guide/spacebars.html). Read this documentation to learn about HTML spacebars and the various Javascript utilities (helpers, onCreated, onRendered, etc.).
 
* [Semantic UI Forms](http://semantic-ui.com/collections/form.html). Read this documentation to learn the CSS classes defined by Semantic UI to create nicely styled forms.
